# Architecture Decisions

- **Config discipline**: Keep `config.py` as runtime default; allow optional YAML overlays.
- **Swarm architecture**: Documented as target; not enforced in core training.
- **Multimodal**: Deferred until text core is proven.
- **Canonical KD lane**: Keep the external lane name `offline_clean`, but treat it as the strict precomputed-KD path for the 45K closure run.
- **Teacher surface**: Pin the teacher to `meta-llama/Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct`; do not silently swap teacher IDs on the canonical path.
- **Fallback boundary**: Remove teacherless fallback from the canonical `offline_clean` training path. If logits are missing, fail with the exact blocker instead of silently downgrading the run.
- **Prompt surface**: Keep `prompts/system_v1.txt` as the only canonical system prompt surface until post-training behavioral evidence justifies expansion.
- **Artifact strategy**: Preserve the existing release/repo zips and add a separate training outputs bundle zip for real run retrieval (`artifacts/mertformer_training_outputs_bundle.zip` + SHA256 + manifests).

## Audited decisions (2026-06-12 zero-contradiction closure) — document, do NOT "re-fix"

A multi-agent audit verified these against current code. They are deliberate, NOT bugs;
a future reviewer/AI should not "fix" them:

- **P5/P8 — README performance table**: throughput/latency figures (~1.2s/step, ~107 tok/s,
  11,000 tok/s aggregate) are explicitly labeled "Projected / Est. / Not Measured /
  architecture simulation" — claim-discipline-compliant projections, not measured claims.
- **P13 — utils/safety.py `kill_if_non_finite`**: exported public utility (`utils/__init__.py`
  `__all__`), not orphaned. Absence of an internal caller is not a defect.
- **P18 — `config.auto_configure_batch_size` nvidia-smi**: no naive LOCAL_RANK guard is added —
  a rank-0-only guard would desync per-rank micro-batch; Method-A (`torch.cuda.get_device_properties`)
  already avoids nvidia-smi on real GPU nodes, and prints are env-gated (`TITAN_CONFIG_VERBOSE`).
- **P11 — `trust_remote_code=True`** on the gated Meta `Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct` teacher load is
  deliberate (trusted first-party repo). Production dataset loads do not enable it.
- **Measured param count `3,672,982,022` (~3.67B)** is the canonical measured runtime total;
  explicit `moe_intermediate=8192` (config/config.py) holds it. `economics/flops_estimator.py`
  `DEFAULT_PARAMS=2.64e9` is the separate design-target and is preserved. See reports/FACTS.json.
- **D3 — Stage-1 code source**: switched `bigcode/the-stack-v2` → `bigcode/the-stack-dedup`. v2 rows
  carry `blob_id`/`src_encoding` (the `content` field is empty and needs Software-Heritage S3
  resolution), which silently starved Stage-1's ~28% code corpus; the-stack-dedup exposes a real
  `content` field. A preflight source smoke-probe now fails loudly (`SOURCE_FIELD_EMPTY`) on any
  empty-field source. `datasets/hashes.json` revision/sha256 for the-stack-dedup must be re-pinned on
  the training machine (network required). Deliberate dataset-policy change.
- **Llama naming**: the Llama 3.3 Community License requests derivative model NAMES include "Llama".
  Current posture: name "MertFormer Titan" + the "Built with Llama" NOTICE; full naming compliance is
  EXTERNAL-PENDING legal (see NOTICE and reports/teacher_output_license_assessment.md).
